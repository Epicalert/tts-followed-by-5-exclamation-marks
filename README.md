# TTS!!!!!
It's basically a TTS engine but it just screams all the time.


## Using TTS!!!!!
### In a python script
	import ttsfbfe.tts
	runTTS("Your sentence here")
### On its own
(Your working directory should be ttsfbfe)
#### Linux
	$ python3 tts.py "Your sentence here"

This TTS engine uses a modified version of the [CMU Pronouncing Dictionary](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict) (version 0.7b) converted to IPA by [Alexander Piperski](https://github.com/menelik3), and converted again to X-SAMPA by [Amado Wilkins](https://github.com/Epicalert).
