# TTS!!!!!
It's basically a TTS engine but it just screams all the time.

This TTS engine uses a modified version of the [CMU Pronouncing Dictionary](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict) (version 0.7b) converted to IPA by [Alexander Piperski](https://github.com/menelik3), and converted again to X-SAMPA by [Amado Wilkins](https://github.com/Epicalert).
