# TTS!!!!!
It's basically a TTS engine but it just screams all the time.


## Using TTS!!!!!
### In a python script
	import ttsfbfe.tts
	runTTS("Your sentence here")
### On its own
#### Linux
Open `runtts.sh`
#### Windows
Open `runtts.bat`

<br>

*Or you can run it from a terminal:*
#### Linux
	$ python3 ttsfbfe/tts.py "Your sentence here"
#### Windows
	> py -3 ttsfbfe/tts.py "Your sentence here"

## Warning!
TTS!!!!! does not work properly in Windows at the moment due to filesystem limitations.
